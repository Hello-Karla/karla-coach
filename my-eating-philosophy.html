<p> Eating is one of the biggest constants in life, therefore it's important to make sure that we eat foods that help us build our health. In addition, to remain us healthy without becoming bedridden in the future, diet also contributes to keeping us nutritionally fit and it prevents illnesses. I think of food as information that talks to our genes and tell them what to do. Poor nutrition can create disease. I'm not a believer of eating everything in moderation, because then also your health ends up to be rather moderate. But nutrition alone is no longer adequate enough in addressing the compelling challenges we face with food. Lasting change and breakthrough happens when we work on both the nutritional and personal dimensions of life.
